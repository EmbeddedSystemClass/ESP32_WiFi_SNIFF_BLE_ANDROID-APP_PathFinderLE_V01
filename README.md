esp32 as wifi Sniffer connected via BLE to Android-App

Target is to create an APP ( Android ) to show my Location on a MAP ( openStreepMaps ? ).
Arround ME on this Map i will see in RealTime the amount of MobileDevices .

To detect and count those Mobile Devices we will use the ESP32 WEMOS Dev Kit
