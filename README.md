# ESP32_WiFi_SNIFF_BLE_ANDROID-APP_PathFinderLE_V01
esp32 as wifi Sniffer connected via BLE to Android-App

Target is to create an APP ( Android ) to show my Location on a MAP ( openStreepMaps ? ).
Arround ME on this Map i want  see in RealTime the amount of MobileDevices .

To detect and count those Mobile Devices we will use the ESP32 WEMOS Dev Kit.

Basic setup:

# ESP32 - Sniffing and first BLE DataTransfer:

Developmentplatform for the esp32 we take VS2017 and vMicro. I recomment this combination as it provoides us some good advantage ( multi-monitoring / good android-Lib-handling etc..)

take care on some specific settings:

This sniffer example here base on some existing code i found on other GitHub-Repos here - thx-credidits to those!  some of them exist only in cpp. so they need some adaption to get compiled as INO.

Another code source is from my study of beacon-scan via the NODE MCU ESP8266..documented here on my Github.

Quite new for me is this BLE-Topoic as the NodeMCU does not have the BLE on board. BLE is a very huge lib. we need to take care to have the right settings..otherwise it cannot be compiled ( err: code is too big ..)

State: 21.04.20

Example code ( https://github.com/iCounterBOX/ESP32_WiFi_SNIFF_BLE_ANDROID-APP_PathFinderLE_V01/tree/master/EXAMPLES/ESP32_bleWrite2Mobile )  is sniffing MAC and just send some CHAR letters vis BLE to my mobile phone.
I test  this with android-App: BLE SCANNER.
Is working fine and is schowing that it is basically possible to combine this promiscuous-Mode in combination with the BLE from the ESP32
